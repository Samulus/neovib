# neovib
neovib is a simple rhthym game inspired by classic rhthym games like Osu!
and Vib-Ribbon. In Neovib the user provides an audio file / selects a random
audio file from their music library and the game will automatically generate
obstacles that coincide with musical onsets in the game. It's an early state
currently but works on Linux.
