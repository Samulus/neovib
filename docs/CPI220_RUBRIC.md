I included a classical song that you can use to test it.
You can also test the game with any music of your own. Neovib accepts everything ffmpeg 
accepts, which is essentially anything with an audiotrack. The project was
definitely within reasonable scope. The only thing I wish I had more time
is so that I could implement more tests and refactor a few design elements
of the project.

> The project properly uses a minimum of 5 algorithms and data structures learned in the course.

Due to the nature of beat detection it can't always return a correct result. But in the majority of cases the algorithm does return a correct result in the vast majority of cases.
I tried almost every single song in my 26GB library of music across generes and it generated a satisfying playthrough in about 85-90% of cases.

The algorithm for beat detection only does a single pass of the audio, taking only a few ms on my desktop and about
1000ms-2000ms max on my Chromebook to do the onset detection for most songs.
